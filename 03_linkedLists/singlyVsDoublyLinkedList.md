## Singly Linked List:

- Fairly simple implementation and consumes less memory.
- Because of less memory when we do thing like insert or delete, it requires less operations.

**Downside:**
- It cannot be iterated reverse since it doesn't hold pointer to previous node.

**When to use:**
- When you have memory constrains.
- Do fast insertion, deletion.
- And not much to do with searching.


## Doubly Linked List:

- Fairly complex in terms of implementation.
- Requires more memory and storage because it holds the pointers to both previous and next node.
- It allows to traverse both the directions.

**Downside:**
- It consumes more memory/storage compared to singly linked list.

**When to use:**
- When you dont have that much limitation on memory.
- Good when you've requirement like searching in both directions.
