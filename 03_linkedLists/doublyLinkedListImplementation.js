/*
A doubly linked list is a more complex data structure than a singly linked list, but it offers several advantages.
The main advantage of a doubly linked list is that it allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions. 
This is because each node in the list contains a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the next node. 
This allows for quick and easy insertion and deletion of nodes from the list, as well as efficient traversal of the list in both directions.
