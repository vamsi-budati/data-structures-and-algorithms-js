# Graphs

- Set of values that are related in a pair wise fashion.
- Each item is called a node or vertex.
- Nodes are then connected with Edges.
- Great ds to model real word relationships representing links
- Ideal for cases when you're working with things that are connected with other things
- Graphs to represent roads, network(E.g. Gmaps uses graphs to determine shortest path)

## Types of graphs

1. Directed(one way)
2. Undirected(two way)

Facebook uses undirected graph(i.e )
Twitter is more directed

**Weighted graphs**
1. Unweighted
2. Weighted(with values in edges)

With graphs we can also have information in the edges.

1. Cyclic(no arrows)
2. Acyclic 

**Graphs are really useful when it comes to Relationships**

**Scaling is hard**
